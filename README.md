## Description

This forms part of the front end for my fifth project with code institute.

This application is used to give a nice look and feel for the properties that are being looked at.
It will have a nicely displayed look and feel with a user Profile were everything can be displayed in one place.

#### [State Store](#table-of-content)

- I have written a state store for this Project
- Using useMemo, useContext and useReducer
- To improve the performance of this app
- If you are wanting to see how it was done, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IHX350WfSIrXJzxKs8IBurmX-wX1dtBG1-rPXqmIB6c/edit#heading=h.1tzm0g2fdwbe)

### [Bugs](#table-of-content)

#### [401 Error](#table-of-content)

##### Problem?

- 401 get request unauthorized error in console
- this error only happens when I am not logged in
- when it is trying to make a get request to the API

![401 get error.png](src/assets/docs/bugs/401_get_error.png)

##### Solution?

- The solution to this problem would be so that the console doesn't show any error message
- I have not quite been able to get this right yet
